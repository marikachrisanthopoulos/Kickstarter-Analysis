# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Objectives
This project has been designed to assist Louise, an aspiring playright, to help her fund her new play, Fever.
Crowdfunding data has been organized, sorted, and analyzed to help Louise determine if there are any specific factors that can influence the funding she receives for her play, in order to provide with the best opportunities for success.

## Outcomes
Data analysis using Microsoft Excel determined that productions launched in the spring and early summer months generally have higher success rates than those launched in the winter, fall, or later summer months.

In addition, successful campaigns overall had lower mean fundraising goals. On average, successful campaigns had goals of about $5K, while failed campaigns had an average goal of $10K.

## Suggestions
In order to plan for a successful campaign, aspiring playrights should not be overly ambitious with their fundraising goals. In addition, they should plan on opening their campaigns in the summer months.
